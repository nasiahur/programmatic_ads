# OPTIONS FOR AUTHENTICATION
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: auth_param
#	This is used to define parameters for the various authentication
#	schemes supported by Squid.
#
#		format: auth_param scheme parameter [setting]
#
#	The order in which authentication schemes are presented to the client is
#	dependent on the order the scheme first appears in config file. IE
#	has a bug (it's not RFC 2617 compliant) in that it will use the basic
#	scheme if basic is the first entry presented, even if more secure
#	schemes are presented. For now use the order in the recommended
#	settings section below. If other browsers have difficulties (don't
#	recognize the schemes offered even if you are using basic) either
#	put basic first, or disable the other schemes (by commenting out their
#	program entry).
#
#	Once an authentication scheme is fully configured, it can only be
#	shutdown by shutting squid down and restarting. Changes can be made on
#	the fly and activated with a reconfigure. I.E. You can change to a
#	different helper, but not unconfigure the helper completely.
#
#	Please note that while this directive defines how Squid processes
#	authentication it does not automatically activate authentication.
#	To use authentication you must in addition make use of ACLs based
#	on login name in http_access (proxy_auth, proxy_auth_regex or
#	external with %LOGIN used in the format tag). The browser will be
#	challenged for authentication on the first such acl encountered
#	in http_access processing and will also be re-challenged for new
#	login credentials if the request is being denied by a proxy_auth
#	type acl.
#
#	WARNING: authentication can't be used in a transparently intercepting
#	proxy as the client then thinks it is talking to an origin server and
#	not the proxy. This is a limitation of bending the TCP/IP protocol to
#	transparently intercepting port 80, not a limitation in Squid.
#	Ports flagged 'transparent', 'intercept', or 'tproxy' have
#	authentication disabled.
#
#	=== Parameters common to all schemes. ===
#
#	"program" cmdline
#		Specifies the command for the external authenticator.
#
#		By default, each authentication scheme is not used unless a
#		program is specified.
#
#		See http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/AddonHelpers for
#		more details on helper operations and creating your own.
#
#	"key_extras" format
#		Specifies a string to be append to request line format for
#		the authentication helper. "Quoted" format values may contain
#		spaces and logformat %macros. In theory, any logformat %macro
#		can be used. In practice, a %macro expands as a dash (-) if
#		the helper request is sent before the required macro
#		information is available to Squid.
#
#		By default, Squid uses request formats provided in
#		scheme-specific examples below (search for %credentials).
#
#		The expanded key_extras value is added to the Squid credentials
#		cache and, hence, will affect authentication. It can be used to
#		autenticate different users with identical user names (e.g.,
#		when user authentication depends on http_port).
#
#		Avoid adding frequently changing information to key_extras. For
#		example, if you add user source IP, and it changes frequently
#		in your environment, then max_user_ip ACL is going to treat
#		every user+IP combination as a unique "user", breaking the ACL
#		and wasting a lot of memory on those user records. It will also
#		force users to authenticate from scratch whenever their IP
#		changes.
#
#	"realm" string
#		Specifies the protection scope (aka realm name) which is to be
#		reported to the client for the authentication scheme. It is
#		commonly part of the text the user will see when prompted for
#		their username and password.
#
#		For Basic the default is "Squid proxy-caching web server".
#		For Digest there is no default, this parameter is mandatory.
#		For NTLM and Negotiate this parameter is ignored.
#
#	"children" numberofchildren [startup=N] [idle=N] [concurrency=N]
#
#		The maximum number of authenticator processes to spawn. If
#		you start too few Squid will have to wait for them to process
#		a backlog of credential verifications, slowing it down. When
#		password verifications are done via a (slow) network you are
#		likely to need lots of authenticator processes.
#
#		The startup= and idle= options permit some skew in the exact
#		amount run. A minimum of startup=N will begin during startup
#		and reconfigure. Squid will start more in groups of up to
#		idle=N in an attempt to meet traffic needs and to keep idle=N
#		free above those traffic needs up to the maximum.
#
#		The concurrency= option sets the number of concurrent requests
#		the helper can process.  The default of 0 is used for helpers
#		who only supports one request at a time. Setting this to a
#		number greater than 0 changes the protocol used to include a
#		channel ID field first on the request/response line, allowing
#		multiple requests to be sent to the same helper in parallel
#		without waiting for the response.
#
#		Concurrency must not be set unless it's known the helper
#		supports the input format with channel-ID fields.
#
#		NOTE: NTLM and Negotiate schemes do not support concurrency
#			in the Squid code module even though some helpers can.
#
#

#  TAG: authenticate_cache_garbage_interval
#	The time period between garbage collection across the username cache.
#	This is a trade-off between memory utilization (long intervals - say
#	2 days) and CPU (short intervals - say 1 minute). Only change if you
#	have good reason to.
#Default:
# authenticate_cache_garbage_interval 1 hour

#  TAG: authenticate_ttl
#	The time a user & their credentials stay in the logged in
#	user cache since their last request. When the garbage
#	interval passes, all user credentials that have passed their
#	TTL are removed from memory.
#Default:
# authenticate_ttl 1 hour

#  TAG: authenticate_ip_ttl
#	If you use proxy authentication and the 'max_user_ip' ACL,
#	this directive controls how long Squid remembers the IP
#	addresses associated with each user.  Use a small value
#	(e.g., 60 seconds) if your users might change addresses
#	quickly, as is the case with dialup.   You might be safe
#	using a larger value (e.g., 2 hours) in a corporate LAN
#	environment with relatively static address assignments.
#Default:
# authenticate_ip_ttl 1 second
