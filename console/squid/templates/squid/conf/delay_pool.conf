# DELAY POOL PARAMETERS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: delay_pools
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       --enable-delay-pools
#
#	This represents the number of delay pools to be used.  For example,
#	if you have one class 2 delay pool and one class 3 delays pool, you
#	have a total of 2 delay pools.
#
#	See also delay_parameters, delay_class, delay_access for pool
#	configuration details.
#Default:
# delay_pools 0

#  TAG: delay_class
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       --enable-delay-pools
#
#	This defines the class of each delay pool.  There must be exactly one
#	delay_class line for each delay pool.  For example, to define two
#	delay pools, one of class 2 and one of class 3, the settings above
#	and here would be:
#
#	Example:
#	    delay_pools 4      # 4 delay pools
#	    delay_class 1 2    # pool 1 is a class 2 pool
#	    delay_class 2 3    # pool 2 is a class 3 pool
#	    delay_class 3 4    # pool 3 is a class 4 pool
#	    delay_class 4 5    # pool 4 is a class 5 pool
#
#	The delay pool classes are:
#
#		class 1		Everything is limited by a single aggregate
#				bucket.
#
#		class 2 	Everything is limited by a single aggregate
#				bucket as well as an "individual" bucket chosen
#				from bits 25 through 32 of the IPv4 address.
#
#		class 3		Everything is limited by a single aggregate
#				bucket as well as a "network" bucket chosen
#				from bits 17 through 24 of the IP address and a
#				"individual" bucket chosen from bits 17 through
#				32 of the IPv4 address.
#
#		class 4		Everything in a class 3 delay pool, with an
#				additional limit on a per user basis. This
#				only takes effect if the username is established
#				in advance - by forcing authentication in your
#				http_access rules.
#
#		class 5		Requests are grouped according their tag (see
#				external_acl's tag= reply).
#
#
#	Each pool also requires a delay_parameters directive to configure the pool size
#	and speed limits used whenever the pool is applied to a request. Along with
#	a set of delay_access directives to determine when it is used.
#
#	NOTE: If an IP address is a.b.c.d
#		-> bits 25 through 32 are "d"
#		-> bits 17 through 24 are "c"
#		-> bits 17 through 32 are "c * 256 + d"
#
#	NOTE-2: Due to the use of bitmasks in class 2,3,4 pools they only apply to
#		IPv4 traffic. Class 1 and 5 pools may be used with IPv6 traffic.
#
#	This clause only supports fast acl types.
#	See http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidAcl for details.
#
#	See also delay_parameters and delay_access.
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: delay_access
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       --enable-delay-pools
#
#	This is used to determine which delay pool a request falls into.
#
#	delay_access is sorted per pool and the matching starts with pool 1,
#	then pool 2, ..., and finally pool N. The first delay pool where the
#	request is allowed is selected for the request. If it does not allow
#	the request to any pool then the request is not delayed (default).
#
#	For example, if you want some_big_clients in delay
#	pool 1 and lotsa_little_clients in delay pool 2:
#
#		delay_access 1 allow some_big_clients
#		delay_access 1 deny all
#		delay_access 2 allow lotsa_little_clients
#		delay_access 2 deny all
#		delay_access 3 allow authenticated_clients
#
#	See also delay_parameters and delay_class.
#
#Default:
# Deny using the pool, unless allow rules exist in squid.conf for the pool.

#  TAG: delay_parameters
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       --enable-delay-pools
#
#	This defines the parameters for a delay pool.  Each delay pool has
#	a number of "buckets" associated with it, as explained in the
#	description of delay_class.
#
#	For a class 1 delay pool, the syntax is:
#		delay_class pool 1
#		delay_parameters pool aggregate
#
#	For a class 2 delay pool:
#		delay_class pool 2
#		delay_parameters pool aggregate individual
#
#	For a class 3 delay pool:
#		delay_class pool 3
#		delay_parameters pool aggregate network individual
#
#	For a class 4 delay pool:
#		delay_class pool 4
#		delay_parameters pool aggregate network individual user
#
#	For a class 5 delay pool:
#		delay_class pool 5
#		delay_parameters pool tagrate
#
#	The option variables are:
#
#		pool		a pool number - ie, a number between 1 and the
#				number specified in delay_pools as used in
#				delay_class lines.
#
#		aggregate	the speed limit parameters for the aggregate bucket
#				(class 1, 2, 3).
#
#		individual	the speed limit parameters for the individual
#				buckets (class 2, 3).
#
#		network		the speed limit parameters for the network buckets
#				(class 3).
#
#		user		the speed limit parameters for the user buckets
#				(class 4).
#
#		tagrate		the speed limit parameters for the tag buckets
#				(class 5).
#
#	A pair of delay parameters is written restore/maximum, where restore is
#	the number of bytes (not bits - modem and network speeds are usually
#	quoted in bits) per second placed into the bucket, and maximum is the
#	maximum number of bytes which can be in the bucket at any time.
#
#	There must be one delay_parameters line for each delay pool.
#
#
#	For example, if delay pool number 1 is a class 2 delay pool as in the
#	above example, and is being used to strictly limit each host to 64Kbit/sec
#	(plus overheads), with no overall limit, the line is:
#
#		delay_parameters 1 none 8000/8000
#
#	Note that 8 x 8K Byte/sec -> 64K bit/sec.
#
#	Note that the word 'none' is used to represent no limit.
#
#
#	And, if delay pool number 2 is a class 3 delay pool as in the above
#	example, and you want to limit it to a total of 256Kbit/sec (strict limit)
#	with each 8-bit network permitted 64Kbit/sec (strict limit) and each
#	individual host permitted 4800bit/sec with a bucket maximum size of 64Kbits
#	to permit a decent web page to be downloaded at a decent speed
#	(if the network is not being limited due to overuse) but slow down
#	large downloads more significantly:
#
#		delay_parameters 2 32000/32000 8000/8000 600/8000
#
#	Note that 8 x  32K Byte/sec ->  256K bit/sec.
#		  8 x   8K Byte/sec ->   64K bit/sec.
#		  8 x 600  Byte/sec -> 4800  bit/sec.
#
#
#	Finally, for a class 4 delay pool as in the example - each user will
#	be limited to 128Kbits/sec no matter how many workstations they are logged into.:
#
#		delay_parameters 4 32000/32000 8000/8000 600/64000 16000/16000
#
#
#	See also delay_class and delay_access.
#
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: delay_initial_bucket_level	(percent, 0-100)
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       --enable-delay-pools
#
#	The initial bucket percentage is used to determine how much is put
#	in each bucket when squid starts, is reconfigured, or first notices
#	a host accessing it (in class 2 and class 3, individual hosts and
#	networks only have buckets associated with them once they have been
#	"seen" by squid).
#Default:
# delay_initial_bucket_level 50
# CLIENT DELAY POOL PARAMETERS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: client_delay_pools
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       --enable-delay-pools
#
#	This option specifies the number of client delay pools used. It must
#	preceed other client_delay_* options.
#
#	Example:
#		client_delay_pools 2
#
#	See also client_delay_parameters and client_delay_access.
#Default:
# client_delay_pools 0

#  TAG: client_delay_initial_bucket_level	(percent, 0-no_limit)
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       --enable-delay-pools
#
#	This option determines the initial bucket size as a percentage of
#	max_bucket_size from client_delay_parameters. Buckets are created
#	at the time of the "first" connection from the matching IP. Idle
#	buckets are periodically deleted up.
#
#	You can specify more than 100 percent but note that such "oversized"
#	buckets are not refilled until their size goes down to max_bucket_size
#	from client_delay_parameters.
#
#	Example:
#		client_delay_initial_bucket_level 50
#Default:
# client_delay_initial_bucket_level 50

#  TAG: client_delay_parameters
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       --enable-delay-pools
#
#
#	This option configures client-side bandwidth limits using the
#	following format:
#
#	    client_delay_parameters pool speed_limit max_bucket_size
#
#	pool is an integer ID used for client_delay_access matching.
#
#	speed_limit is bytes added to the bucket per second.
#
#	max_bucket_size is the maximum size of a bucket, enforced after any
#	speed_limit additions.
#
#	Please see the delay_parameters option for more information and
#	examples.
#
#	Example:
#		client_delay_parameters 1 1024 2048
#		client_delay_parameters 2 51200 16384
#
#	See also client_delay_access.
#
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: client_delay_access
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       --enable-delay-pools
#
#	This option determines the client-side delay pool for the
#	request:
#
#	    client_delay_access pool_ID allow|deny acl_name
#
#	All client_delay_access options are checked in their pool ID
#	order, starting with pool 1. The first checked pool with allowed
#	request is selected for the request. If no ACL matches or there
#	are no client_delay_access options, the request bandwidth is not
#	limited.
#
#	The ACL-selected pool is then used to find the
#	client_delay_parameters for the request. Client-side pools are
#	not used to aggregate clients. Clients are always aggregated
#	based on their source IP addresses (one bucket per source IP).
#
#	This clause only supports fast acl types.
#	See http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidAcl for details.
#	Additionally, only the client TCP connection details are available.
#	ACLs testing HTTP properties will not work.
#
#	Please see delay_access for more examples.
#
#	Example:
#		client_delay_access 1 allow low_rate_network
#		client_delay_access 2 allow vips_network
#
#
#	See also client_delay_parameters and client_delay_pools.
#Default:
# Deny use of the pool, unless allow rules exist in squid.conf for the pool.
