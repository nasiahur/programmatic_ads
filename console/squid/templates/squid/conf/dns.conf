
# DNS OPTIONS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: check_hostnames
#	For security and stability reasons Squid can check
#	hostnames for Internet standard RFC compliance. If you want
#	Squid to perform these checks turn this directive on.
#Default:
# check_hostnames off

#  TAG: allow_underscore
#	Underscore characters is not strictly allowed in Internet hostnames
#	but nevertheless used by many sites. Set this to off if you want
#	Squid to be strict about the standard.
#	This check is performed only when check_hostnames is set to on.
#Default:
# allow_underscore on

#  TAG: dns_retransmit_interval
#	Initial retransmit interval for DNS queries. The interval is
#	doubled each time all configured DNS servers have been tried.
#Default:
# dns_retransmit_interval 5 seconds

#  TAG: dns_timeout
#	DNS Query timeout. If no response is received to a DNS query
#	within this time all DNS servers for the queried domain
#	are assumed to be unavailable.
#Default:
dns_timeout {{dns.dns_timeout}} seconds

#  TAG: dns_packet_max
#	Maximum number of bytes packet size to advertise via EDNS.
#	Set to "none" to disable EDNS large packet support.
#	
#	For legacy reasons DNS UDP replies will default to 512 bytes which
#	is too small for many responses. EDNS provides a means for Squid to
#	negotiate receiving larger responses back immediately without having
#	to failover with repeat requests. Responses larger than this limit
#	will retain the old behaviour of failover to TCP DNS.
#	
#	Squid has no real fixed limit internally, but allowing packet sizes
#	over 1500 bytes requires network jumbogram support and is usually not
#	necessary.
#	
#	WARNING: The RFC also indicates that some older resolvers will reply
#	with failure of the whole request if the extension is added. Some
#	resolvers have already been identified which will reply with mangled
#	EDNS response on occasion. Usually in response to many-KB jumbogram
#	sizes being advertised by Squid.
#	Squid will currently treat these both as an unable-to-resolve domain
#	even if it would be resolvable without EDNS.
#Default:
# EDNS disabled

#  TAG: dns_defnames	on|off
#	Normally the RES_DEFNAMES resolver option is disabled
#	(see res_init(3)).  This prevents caches in a hierarchy
#	from interpreting single-component hostnames locally.  To allow
#	Squid to handle single-component names, enable this option.
#Default:
# Search for single-label domain names is disabled.

#  TAG: dns_multicast_local	on|off
#	When set to on, Squid sends multicast DNS lookups on the local
#	network for domains ending in .local and .arpa.
#	This enables local servers and devices to be contacted in an
#	ad-hoc or zero-configuration network environment.
#Default:
# Search for .local and .arpa names is disabled.

#  TAG: dns_nameservers
#	Use this if you want to specify a list of DNS name servers
#	(IP addresses) to use instead of those given in your
#	/etc/resolv.conf file.
#
#	On Windows platforms, if no value is specified here or in
#	the /etc/resolv.conf file, the list of DNS name servers are
#	taken from the Windows registry, both static and dynamic DHCP
#	configurations are supported.
#
#	Example: dns_nameservers 10.0.0.1 192.172.0.4
#Default:
{% if dns.dns_nameservers %}dns_nameservers {{dns.dns_nameservers}}
{%else%}# Use operating system definitions{% endif %}

#  TAG: hosts_file
#	Location of the host-local IP name-address associations
#	database. Most Operating Systems have such a file on different
#	default locations:
#	- Un*X & Linux:    /etc/hosts
#	- Windows NT/2000: %SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts
#			   (%SystemRoot% value install default is c:\winnt)
#	- Windows XP/2003: %SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts
#			   (%SystemRoot% value install default is c:\windows)
#	- Windows 9x/Me:   %windir%\hosts
#			   (%windir% value is usually c:\windows)
#	- Cygwin:	   /etc/hosts
#
#	The file contains newline-separated definitions, in the
#	form ip_address_in_dotted_form name [name ...] names are
#	whitespace-separated. Lines beginning with an hash (#)
#	character are comments.
#
#	The file is checked at startup and upon configuration.
#	If set to 'none', it won't be checked.
#	If append_domain is used, that domain will be added to
#	domain-local (i.e. not containing any dot character) host
#	definitions.
#Default:
# hosts_file /etc/hosts

#  TAG: append_domain
#	Appends local domain name to hostnames without any dots in
#	them.  append_domain must begin with a period.
#
#	Be warned there are now Internet names with no dots in
#	them using only top-domain names, so setting this may
#	cause some Internet sites to become unavailable.
#
#Example:
# append_domain .yourdomain.com
#Default:
# Use operating system definitions

#  TAG: ignore_unknown_nameservers
#	By default Squid checks that DNS responses are received
#	from the same IP addresses they are sent to.  If they
#	don't match, Squid ignores the response and writes a warning
#	message to cache.log.  You can allow responses from unknown
#	nameservers by setting this option to 'off'.
#Default:
# ignore_unknown_nameservers on

#  TAG: dns_v4_first
#	With the IPv6 Internet being as fast or faster than IPv4 Internet
#	for most networks Squid prefers to contact websites over IPv6.
#
#	This option reverses the order of preference to make Squid contact
#	dual-stack websites over IPv4 first. Squid will still perform both
#	IPv6 and IPv4 DNS lookups before connecting.
#
#	WARNING:
#	  This option will restrict the situations under which IPv6
#	  connectivity is used (and tested). Hiding network problems
#	  which would otherwise be detected and warned about.
#Default:
dns_v4_first {% if dns.dns_v4_first %}on{%else%}off{% endif %}

#  TAG: ipcache_size	(number of entries)
#	Maximum number of DNS IP cache entries.
#Default:
# ipcache_size 1024

#  TAG: ipcache_low	(percent)
#Default:
# ipcache_low 90

#  TAG: ipcache_high	(percent)
#	The size, low-, and high-water marks for the IP cache.
#Default:
# ipcache_high 95

#  TAG: fqdncache_size	(number of entries)
#	Maximum number of FQDN cache entries.
#Default:
# fqdncache_size 1024
