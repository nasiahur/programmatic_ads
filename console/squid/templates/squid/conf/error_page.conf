# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: error_directory
#	If you wish to create your own versions of the default
#	error files to customize them to suit your company copy
#	the error/template files to another directory and point
#	this tag at them.
#
#	WARNING: This option will disable multi-language support
#	         on error pages if used.
#
#	The squid developers are interested in making squid available in
#	a wide variety of languages. If you are making translations for a
#	language that Squid does not currently provide please consider
#	contributing your translation back to the project.
#	http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Translations
#
#	The squid developers working on translations are happy to supply drop-in
#	translated error files in exchange for any new language contributions.
#Default:
# Send error pages in the clients preferred language

#  TAG: error_default_language
#	Set the default language which squid will send error pages in
#	if no existing translation matches the clients language
#	preferences.
#
#	If unset (default) generic English will be used.
#
#	The squid developers are interested in making squid available in
#	a wide variety of languages. If you are interested in making
#	translations for any language see the squid wiki for details.
#	http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Translations
#Default:
# Generate English language pages.

#  TAG: error_log_languages
#	Log to cache.log what languages users are attempting to
#	auto-negotiate for translations.
#
#	Successful negotiations are not logged. Only failures
#	have meaning to indicate that Squid may need an upgrade
#	of its error page translations.
#Default:
# error_log_languages on

#  TAG: err_page_stylesheet
#	CSS Stylesheet to pattern the display of Squid default error pages.
#
#	For information on CSS see http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/
#Default:
# err_page_stylesheet /home/builder/squid/etc/errorpage.css

#  TAG: err_html_text
#	HTML text to include in error messages.  Make this a "mailto"
#	URL to your admin address, or maybe just a link to your
#	organizations Web page.
#
#	To include this in your error messages, you must rewrite
#	the error template files (found in the "errors" directory).
#	Wherever you want the 'err_html_text' line to appear,
#	insert a %L tag in the error template file.
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: email_err_data	on|off
#	If enabled, information about the occurred error will be
#	included in the mailto links of the ERR pages (if %W is set)
#	so that the email body contains the data.
#	Syntax is <A HREF="mailto:%w%W">%w</A>
#Default:
# email_err_data on

#  TAG: deny_info
#	Usage:   deny_info err_page_name acl
#	or       deny_info http://... acl
#	or       deny_info TCP_RESET acl
#
#	This can be used to return a ERR_ page for requests which
#	do not pass the 'http_access' rules.  Squid remembers the last
#	acl it evaluated in http_access, and if a 'deny_info' line exists
#	for that ACL Squid returns a corresponding error page.
#
#	The acl is typically the last acl on the http_access deny line which
#	denied access. The exceptions to this rule are:
#	- When Squid needs to request authentication credentials. It's then
#	  the first authentication related acl encountered
#	- When none of the http_access lines matches. It's then the last
#	  acl processed on the last http_access line.
#	- When the decision to deny access was made by an adaptation service,
#	  the acl name is the corresponding eCAP or ICAP service_name.
#
#	NP: If providing your own custom error pages with error_directory
#	    you may also specify them by your custom file name:
#	    Example: deny_info ERR_CUSTOM_ACCESS_DENIED bad_guys
#
#	By defaut Squid will send "403 Forbidden". A different 4xx or 5xx
#	may be specified by prefixing the file name with the code and a colon.
#	e.g. 404:ERR_CUSTOM_ACCESS_DENIED
#
#	Alternatively you can tell Squid to reset the TCP connection
#	by specifying TCP_RESET.
#
#	Or you can specify an error URL or URL pattern. The browsers will
#	get redirected to the specified URL after formatting tags have
#	been replaced. Redirect will be done with 302 or 307 according to
#	HTTP/1.1 specs. A different 3xx code may be specified by prefixing
#	the URL. e.g. 303:http://example.com/

#		%a	- username (if available. Password NOT included)
