# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: ftp_user
#	If you want the anonymous login password to be more informative
#	(and enable the use of picky FTP servers), set this to something
#	reasonable for your domain, like wwwuser@somewhere.net
#
#	The reason why this is domainless by default is the
#	request can be made on the behalf of a user in any domain,
#	depending on how the cache is used.
#	Some FTP server also validate the email address is valid
#	(for example perl.com).
#Default:
# ftp_user Squid@

#  TAG: ftp_passive
#	If your firewall does not allow Squid to use passive
#	connections, turn off this option.
#
#	Use of ftp_epsv_all option requires this to be ON.
#Default:
# ftp_passive on

#  TAG: ftp_epsv_all
#	FTP Protocol extensions permit the use of a special "EPSV ALL" command.
#
#	NATs may be able to put the connection on a "fast path" through the
#	translator, as the EPRT command will never be used and therefore,
#	translation of the data portion of the segments will never be needed.
#
#	When a client only expects to do two-way FTP transfers this may be
#	useful.
#	If squid finds that it must do a three-way FTP transfer after issuing
#	an EPSV ALL command, the FTP session will fail.
#
#	If you have any doubts about this option do not use it.
#	Squid will nicely attempt all other connection methods.
#
#	Requires ftp_passive to be ON (default) for any effect.
#Default:
# ftp_epsv_all off

#  TAG: ftp_epsv
#	FTP Protocol extensions permit the use of a special "EPSV" command.
#
#	NATs may be able to put the connection on a "fast path" through the
#	translator using EPSV, as the EPRT command will never be used
#	and therefore, translation of the data portion of the segments 
#	will never be needed.
#
#	EPSV is often required to interoperate with FTP servers on IPv6
#	networks. On the other hand, it may break some IPv4 servers.
#
#	By default, EPSV may try EPSV with any FTP server. To fine tune
#	that decision, you may restrict EPSV to certain clients or servers
#	using ACLs:
#
#		ftp_epsv allow|deny al1 acl2 ...
#
#	WARNING: Disabling EPSV may cause problems with external NAT and IPv6.
#
#	Only fast ACLs are supported.
#	Requires ftp_passive to be ON (default) for any effect.
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: ftp_eprt
#	FTP Protocol extensions permit the use of a special "EPRT" command.
#
#	This extension provides a protocol neutral alternative to the
#	IPv4-only PORT command. When supported it enables active FTP data
#	channels over IPv6 and efficient NAT handling.
#
#	Turning this OFF will prevent EPRT being attempted and will skip
#	straight to using PORT for IPv4 servers.
#
#	Some devices are known to not handle this extension correctly and
#	may result in crashes. Devices which suport EPRT enough to fail
#	cleanly will result in Squid attempting PORT anyway. This directive
#	should only be disabled when EPRT results in device failures.
#
#	WARNING: Doing so will convert Squid back to the old behavior with all
#	the related problems with external NAT devices/layers and IPv4-only FTP.
#Default:
# ftp_eprt on

#  TAG: ftp_sanitycheck
#	For security and data integrity reasons Squid by default performs
#	sanity checks of the addresses of FTP data connections ensure the
#	data connection is to the requested server. If you need to allow
#	FTP connections to servers using another IP address for the data
#	connection turn this off.
#Default:
# ftp_sanitycheck on

#  TAG: ftp_telnet_protocol
#	The FTP protocol is officially defined to use the telnet protocol
#	as transport channel for the control connection. However, many
#	implementations are broken and does not respect this aspect of
#	the FTP protocol.
#
#	If you have trouble accessing files with ASCII code 255 in the
#	path or similar problems involving this ASCII code you can
#	try setting this directive to off. If that helps, report to the
#	operator of the FTP server in question that their FTP server
#	is broken and does not follow the FTP standard.
#Default:
# ftp_telnet_protocol on
