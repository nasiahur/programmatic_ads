# ICP OPTIONS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: icp_port
#	The port number where Squid sends and receives ICP queries to
#	and from neighbor caches.  The standard UDP port for ICP is 3130.
#
#	Example:
#		icp_port 3130
#Default:
# ICP disabled.

#  TAG: htcp_port
#	The port number where Squid sends and receives HTCP queries to
#	and from neighbor caches.  To turn it on you want to set it to
#	4827.
#
#	Example:
#		htcp_port 4827
#Default:
# HTCP disabled.

#  TAG: log_icp_queries	on|off
#	If set, ICP queries are logged to access.log. You may wish
#	do disable this if your ICP load is VERY high to speed things
#	up or to simplify log analysis.
#Default:
# log_icp_queries on

#  TAG: udp_incoming_address
#	udp_incoming_address	is used for UDP packets received from other
#				caches.
#
#	The default behavior is to not bind to any specific address.
#
#	Only change this if you want to have all UDP queries received on
#	a specific interface/address.
#
#	NOTE: udp_incoming_address is used by the ICP, HTCP, and DNS
#	modules. Altering it will affect all of them in the same manner.
#
#	see also; udp_outgoing_address
#
#	NOTE, udp_incoming_address and udp_outgoing_address can not
#	have the same value since they both use the same port.
#Default:
# Accept packets from all machine interfaces.

#  TAG: udp_outgoing_address
#	udp_outgoing_address	is used for UDP packets sent out to other
#				caches.
#
#	The default behavior is to not bind to any specific address.
#
#	Instead it will use the same socket as udp_incoming_address.
#	Only change this if you want to have UDP queries sent using another
#	address than where this Squid listens for UDP queries from other
#	caches.
#
#	NOTE: udp_outgoing_address is used by the ICP, HTCP, and DNS
#	modules. Altering it will affect all of them in the same manner.
#
#	see also; udp_incoming_address
#
#	NOTE, udp_incoming_address and udp_outgoing_address can not
#	have the same value since they both use the same port.
#Default:
# Use udp_incoming_address or an address selected by the operating system.

#  TAG: icp_hit_stale	on|off
#	If you want to return ICP_HIT for stale cache objects, set this
#	option to 'on'.  If you have sibling relationships with caches
#	in other administrative domains, this should be 'off'.  If you only
#	have sibling relationships with caches under your control,
#	it is probably okay to set this to 'on'.
#	If set to 'on', your siblings should use the option "allow-miss"
#	on their cache_peer lines for connecting to you.
#Default:
# icp_hit_stale off

#  TAG: minimum_direct_hops
#	If using the ICMP pinging stuff, do direct fetches for sites
#	which are no more than this many hops away.
#Default:
# minimum_direct_hops 4

#  TAG: minimum_direct_rtt	(msec)
#	If using the ICMP pinging stuff, do direct fetches for sites
#	which are no more than this many rtt milliseconds away.
#Default:
# minimum_direct_rtt 400

#  TAG: netdb_low
#	The low water mark for the ICMP measurement database.
#
#	Note: high watermark controlled by netdb_high directive.
#
#	These watermarks are counts, not percents.  The defaults are
#	(low) 900 and (high) 1000.  When the high water mark is
#	reached, database entries will be deleted until the low
#	mark is reached.
#Default:
# netdb_low 900

#  TAG: netdb_high
#	The high water mark for the ICMP measurement database.
#
#	Note: low watermark controlled by netdb_low directive.
#
#	These watermarks are counts, not percents.  The defaults are
#	(low) 900 and (high) 1000.  When the high water mark is
#	reached, database entries will be deleted until the low
#	mark is reached.
#Default:
# netdb_high 1000

#  TAG: netdb_ping_period
#	The minimum period for measuring a site.  There will be at
#	least this much delay between successive pings to the same
#	network.  The default is five minutes.
#Default:
# netdb_ping_period 5 minutes

#  TAG: query_icmp	on|off
#	If you want to ask your peers to include ICMP data in their ICP
#	replies, enable this option.
#
#	If your peer has configured Squid (during compilation) with
#	'--enable-icmp' that peer will send ICMP pings to origin server
#	sites of the URLs it receives.  If you enable this option the
#	ICP replies from that peer will include the ICMP data (if available).
#	Then, when choosing a parent cache, Squid will choose the parent with
#	the minimal RTT to the origin server.  When this happens, the
#	hierarchy field of the access.log will be
#	"CLOSEST_PARENT_MISS".  This option is off by default.
#Default:
# query_icmp off

#  TAG: test_reachability	on|off
#	When this is 'on', ICP MISS replies will be ICP_MISS_NOFETCH
#	instead of ICP_MISS if the target host is NOT in the ICMP
#	database, or has a zero RTT.
#Default:
# test_reachability off

#  TAG: icp_query_timeout	(msec)
#	Normally Squid will automatically determine an optimal ICP
#	query timeout value based on the round-trip-time of recent ICP
#	queries.  If you want to override the value determined by
#	Squid, set this 'icp_query_timeout' to a non-zero value.  This
#	value is specified in MILLISECONDS, so, to use a 2-second
#	timeout (the old default), you would write:
#
#		icp_query_timeout 2000
#Default:
# Dynamic detection.

#  TAG: maximum_icp_query_timeout	(msec)
#	Normally the ICP query timeout is determined dynamically.  But
#	sometimes it can lead to very large values (say 5 seconds).
#	Use this option to put an upper limit on the dynamic timeout
#	value.  Do NOT use this option to always use a fixed (instead
#	of a dynamic) timeout value. To set a fixed timeout see the
#	'icp_query_timeout' directive.
#Default:
# maximum_icp_query_timeout 2000

#  TAG: minimum_icp_query_timeout	(msec)
#	Normally the ICP query timeout is determined dynamically.  But
#	sometimes it can lead to very small timeouts, even lower than
#	the normal latency variance on your link due to traffic.
#	Use this option to put an lower limit on the dynamic timeout
#	value.  Do NOT use this option to always use a fixed (instead
#	of a dynamic) timeout value. To set a fixed timeout see the
#	'icp_query_timeout' directive.
#Default:
# minimum_icp_query_timeout 5

#  TAG: background_ping_rate	time-units
#	Controls how often the ICP pings are sent to siblings that
#	have background-ping set.
#Default:
# background_ping_rate 10 seconds
