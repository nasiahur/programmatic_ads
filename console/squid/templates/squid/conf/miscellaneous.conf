# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: configuration_includes_quoted_values	on|off
#	If set, Squid will recognize each "quoted string" after a configuration
#	directive as a single parameter. The quotes are stripped before the
#	parameter value is interpreted or used.
#	See "Values with spaces, quotes, and other special characters"
#	section for more details.
#Default:
# configuration_includes_quoted_values off

#  TAG: memory_pools	on|off
#	If set, Squid will keep pools of allocated (but unused) memory
#	available for future use.  If memory is a premium on your
#	system and you believe your malloc library outperforms Squid
#	routines, disable this.
#Default:
# memory_pools on

#  TAG: memory_pools_limit	(bytes)
#	Used only with memory_pools on:
#	memory_pools_limit 50 MB
#
#	If set to a non-zero value, Squid will keep at most the specified
#	limit of allocated (but unused) memory in memory pools. All free()
#	requests that exceed this limit will be handled by your malloc
#	library. Squid does not pre-allocate any memory, just safe-keeps
#	objects that otherwise would be free()d. Thus, it is safe to set
#	memory_pools_limit to a reasonably high value even if your
#	configuration will use less memory.
#
#	If set to none, Squid will keep all memory it can. That is, there
#	will be no limit on the total amount of memory used for safe-keeping.
#
#	To disable memory allocation optimization, do not set
#	memory_pools_limit to 0 or none. Set memory_pools to "off" instead.
#
#	An overhead for maintaining memory pools is not taken into account
#	when the limit is checked. This overhead is close to four bytes per
#	object kept. However, pools may actually _save_ memory because of
#	reduced memory thrashing in your malloc library.
#Default:
# memory_pools_limit 5 MB

#  TAG: forwarded_for	on|off|transparent|truncate|delete
#	If set to "on", Squid will append your client's IP address
#	in the HTTP requests it forwards. By default it looks like:
#
#		X-Forwarded-For: 192.1.2.3
#
#	If set to "off", it will appear as
#
#		X-Forwarded-For: unknown
#
#	If set to "transparent", Squid will not alter the
#	X-Forwarded-For header in any way.
#
#	If set to "delete", Squid will delete the entire
#	X-Forwarded-For header.
#
#	If set to "truncate", Squid will remove all existing
#	X-Forwarded-For entries, and place the client IP as the sole entry.
#Default:
# forwarded_for on
{% if miscellaneous.forwarded_for == 0 %}forwarded_for off
{% elif miscellaneous.forwarded_for == 1 %}forwarded_for on
{% elif miscellaneous.forwarded_for == 2 %}forwarded_for transparent
{% elif miscellaneous.forwarded_for == 3 %}forwarded_for truncate
{% elif miscellaneous.forwarded_for == 4 %}forwarded_for delete
{% else %}{% endif %}

#  TAG: cachemgr_passwd
#	Specify passwords for cachemgr operations.
#
#	Usage: cachemgr_passwd password action action ...
#
#	Some valid actions are (see cache manager menu for a full list):
#		5min
#		60min
#		asndb
#		authenticator
#		cbdata
#		client_list
#		comm_incoming
#		config *
#		counters
#		delay
#		digest_stats
#		dns
#		events
#		filedescriptors
#		fqdncache
#		histograms
#		http_headers
#		info
#		io
#		ipcache
#		mem
#		menu
#		netdb
#		non_peers
#		objects
#		offline_toggle *
#		pconn
#		peer_select
#		reconfigure *
#		redirector
#		refresh
#		server_list
#		shutdown *
#		store_digest
#		storedir
#		utilization
#		via_headers
#		vm_objects
#
#	* Indicates actions which will not be performed without a
#	  valid password, others can be performed if not listed here.
#
#	To disable an action, set the password to "disable".
#	To allow performing an action without a password, set the
#	password to "none".
#
#	Use the keyword "all" to set the same password for all actions.
#
#Example:
# cachemgr_passwd secret shutdown
# cachemgr_passwd lesssssssecret info stats/objects
# cachemgr_passwd disable all
#Default:
# No password. Actions which require password are denied.

#  TAG: client_db	on|off
#	If you want to disable collecting per-client statistics,
#	turn off client_db here.
#Default:
# client_db on

#  TAG: refresh_all_ims	on|off
#	When you enable this option, squid will always check
#	the origin server for an update when a client sends an
#	If-Modified-Since request.  Many browsers use IMS
#	requests when the user requests a reload, and this
#	ensures those clients receive the latest version.
#
#	By default (off), squid may return a Not Modified response
#	based on the age of the cached version.
#Default:
# refresh_all_ims off

#  TAG: reload_into_ims	on|off
#	When you enable this option, client no-cache or ``reload''
#	requests will be changed to If-Modified-Since requests.
#	Doing this VIOLATES the HTTP standard.  Enabling this
#	feature could make you liable for problems which it
#	causes.
#
#	see also refresh_pattern for a more selective approach.
#Default:
# reload_into_ims off

#  TAG: connect_retries
#	This sets the maximum number of connection attempts made for each
#	TCP connection. The connect_retries attempts must all still
#	complete within the connection timeout period.
#
#	The default is not to re-try if the first connection attempt fails.
#	The (not recommended) maximum is 10 tries.
#
#	A warning message will be generated if it is set to a too-high
#	value and the configured value will be over-ridden.
#
#	Note: These re-tries are in addition to forward_max_tries
#	which limit how many different addresses may be tried to find
#	a useful server.
#Default:
# Do not retry failed connections.

#  TAG: retry_on_error
#	If set to ON Squid will automatically retry requests when
#	receiving an error response with status 403 (Forbidden),
#	500 (Internal Error), 501 or 503 (Service not available).
#	Status 502 and 504 (Gateway errors) are always retried.
#	
#	This is mainly useful if you are in a complex cache hierarchy to
#	work around access control errors.
#	
#	NOTE: This retry will attempt to find another working destination.
#	Which is different from the server which just failed.
#Default:
# retry_on_error off

#  TAG: as_whois_server
#	WHOIS server to query for AS numbers.  NOTE: AS numbers are
#	queried only when Squid starts up, not for every request.
#Default:
# as_whois_server whois.ra.net

#  TAG: offline_mode
#	Enable this option and Squid will never try to validate cached
#	objects.
#Default:
# offline_mode off

#  TAG: uri_whitespace
#	What to do with requests that have whitespace characters in the
#	URI.  Options:
#
#	strip:  The whitespace characters are stripped out of the URL.
#		This is the behavior recommended by RFC2396 and RFC3986
#		for tolerant handling of generic URI.
#		NOTE: This is one difference between generic URI and HTTP URLs.
#
#	deny:   The request is denied.  The user receives an "Invalid
#		Request" message.
#		This is the behaviour recommended by RFC2616 for safe
#		handling of HTTP request URL.
#
#	allow:  The request is allowed and the URI is not changed.  The
#		whitespace characters remain in the URI.  Note the
#		whitespace is passed to redirector processes if they
#		are in use.
#		Note this may be considered a violation of RFC2616
#		request parsing where whitespace is prohibited in the
#		URL field.
#
#	encode:	The request is allowed and the whitespace characters are
#		encoded according to RFC1738.
#
#	chop:	The request is allowed and the URI is chopped at the
#		first whitespace.
#
#
#	NOTE the current Squid implementation of encode and chop violates
#	RFC2616 by not using a 301 redirect after altering the URL.
#Default:
# uri_whitespace strip

#  TAG: chroot
#	Specifies a directory where Squid should do a chroot() while
#	initializing.  This also causes Squid to fully drop root
#	privileges after initializing.  This means, for example, if you
#	use a HTTP port less than 1024 and try to reconfigure, you may
#	get an error saying that Squid can not open the port.
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: balance_on_multiple_ip
#	Modern IP resolvers in squid sort lookup results by preferred access.
#	By default squid will use these IP in order and only rotates to
#	the next listed when the most preffered fails.
#
#	Some load balancing servers based on round robin DNS have been
#	found not to preserve user session state across requests
#	to different IP addresses.
#
#	Enabling this directive Squid rotates IP's per request.
#Default:
# balance_on_multiple_ip off

#  TAG: pipeline_prefetch
#	HTTP clients may send a pipeline of 1+N requests to Squid using a
#	single connection, without waiting for Squid to respond to the first
#	of those requests. This option limits the number of concurrent
#	requests Squid will try to handle in parallel. If set to N, Squid
#	will try to receive and process up to 1+N requests on the same
#	connection concurrently.
#
#	Defaults to 0 (off) for bandwidth management and access logging
#	reasons.
#
#	NOTE: pipelining requires persistent connections to clients.
#
#	WARNING: pipelining breaks NTLM and Negotiate/Kerberos authentication.
#Default:
# Do not pre-parse pipelined requests.

#  TAG: high_response_time_warning	(msec)
#	If the one-minute median response time exceeds this value,
#	Squid prints a WARNING with debug level 0 to get the
#	administrators attention.  The value is in milliseconds.
#Default:
# disabled.

#  TAG: high_page_fault_warning
#	If the one-minute average page fault rate exceeds this
#	value, Squid prints a WARNING with debug level 0 to get
#	the administrators attention.  The value is in page faults
#	per second.
#Default:
# disabled.

#  TAG: high_memory_warning
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       GNU Malloc with mstats()
#
#	If the memory usage (as determined by gnumalloc, if available and used)
#	exceeds	this amount, Squid prints a WARNING with debug level 0 to get
#	the administrators attention.
#Default:
# disabled.

#  TAG: sleep_after_fork	(microseconds)
#	When this is set to a non-zero value, the main Squid process
#	sleeps the specified number of microseconds after a fork()
#	system call. This sleep may help the situation where your
#	system reports fork() failures due to lack of (virtual)
#	memory. Note, however, if you have a lot of child
#	processes, these sleep delays will add up and your
#	Squid will not service requests for some amount of time
#	until all the child processes have been started.
#	On Windows value less then 1000 (1 milliseconds) are
#	rounded to 1000.
#Default:
# sleep_after_fork 0

#  TAG: windows_ipaddrchangemonitor	on|off
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       MS Windows
#
#	On Windows Squid by default will monitor IP address changes and will 
#	reconfigure itself after any detected event. This is very useful for
#	proxies connected to internet with dial-up interfaces.
#	In some cases (a Proxy server acting as VPN gateway is one) it could be
#	desiderable to disable this behaviour setting this to 'off'.
#	Note: after changing this, Squid service must be restarted.
#Default:
# windows_ipaddrchangemonitor on

#  TAG: eui_lookup
#	Whether to lookup the EUI or MAC address of a connected client.
#Default:
# eui_lookup on

#  TAG: max_filedescriptors
#	Reduce the maximum number of filedescriptors supported below
#	the usual operating system defaults.
#
#	Remove from squid.conf to inherit the current ulimit setting.
#
#	Note: Changing this requires a restart of Squid. Also
#	not all I/O types supports large values (eg on Windows).
#Default:
# Use operating system limits set by ulimit.
