
# OPTIONS FOR STORE ID
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: store_id_program
#	Specify the location of the executable StoreID helper to use.
#	Since they can perform almost any function there isn't one included.
#
#	For each requested URL, the helper will receive one line with the format
#
#	  [channel-ID <SP>] URL [<SP> extras]<NL>
#
#
#	After processing the request the helper must reply using the following format:
#
#	  [channel-ID <SP>] result [<SP> kv-pairs]
#
#	The result code can be:
#
#	  OK store-id="..."
#		Use the StoreID supplied in 'store-id='.
#
#	  ERR
#		The default is to use HTTP request URL as the store ID.
#
#	  BH
#		An internal error occured in the helper, preventing
#		a result being identified.
#
#	In addition to the above kv-pairs Squid also understands the following
#	optional kv-pairs received from URL rewriters:
#	  clt_conn_tag=TAG
#		Associates a TAG with the client TCP connection.
#		Please see url_rewrite_program related documentation for this
#		kv-pair
#
#	Helper programs should be prepared to receive and possibly ignore
#	additional whitespace-separated tokens on each input line.
#
#	When using the concurrency= option the protocol is changed by
#	introducing a query channel tag in front of the request/response.
#	The query channel tag is a number between 0 and concurrency-1.
#	This value must be echoed back unchanged to Squid as the first part
#	of the response relating to its request.
#
#	NOTE: when using StoreID refresh_pattern will apply to the StoreID
#	      returned from the helper and not the URL.
#
#	WARNING: Wrong StoreID value returned by a careless helper may result
#	         in the wrong cached response returned to the user.
#
#	By default, a StoreID helper is not used.
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: store_id_extras
#        Specifies a string to be append to request line format for the
#        StoreId helper. "Quoted" format values may contain spaces and
#        logformat %macros. In theory, any logformat %macro can be used.
#        In practice, a %macro expands as a dash (-) if the helper request is
#        sent before the required macro information is available to Squid.
#Default:
# store_id_extras "%>a/%>A %un %>rm myip=%la myport=%lp"

#  TAG: store_id_children
#	The maximum number of StoreID helper processes to spawn. If you limit
#	it too few Squid will have to wait for them to process a backlog of
#	requests, slowing it down. If you allow too many they will use RAM
#	and other system resources noticably.
#	
#	The startup= and idle= options allow some measure of skew in your
#	tuning.
#	
#		startup=
#	
#	Sets a minimum of how many processes are to be spawned when Squid
#	starts or reconfigures. When set to zero the first request will
#	cause spawning of the first child process to handle it.
#	
#	Starting too few will cause an initial slowdown in traffic as Squid
#	attempts to simultaneously spawn enough processes to cope.
#	
#		idle=
#	
#	Sets a minimum of how many processes Squid is to try and keep available
#	at all times. When traffic begins to rise above what the existing
#	processes can handle this many more will be spawned up to the maximum
#	configured. A minimum setting of 1 is required.
#
#		concurrency=
#
#	The number of requests each storeID helper can handle in
#	parallel. Defaults to 0 which indicates the helper
#	is a old-style single threaded program.
#
#	When this directive is set to a value >= 1 then the protocol
#	used to communicate with the helper is modified to include
#	an ID in front of the request/response. The ID from the request
#	must be echoed back with the response to that request.
#Default:
# store_id_children 20 startup=0 idle=1 concurrency=0

#  TAG: store_id_access
#	If defined, this access list specifies which requests are
#	sent to the StoreID processes.  By default all requests
#	are sent.
#
#	This clause supports both fast and slow acl types.
#	See http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidAcl for details.
#Default:
# Allow, unless rules exist in squid.conf.

#  TAG: store_id_bypass
#	When this is 'on', a request will not go through the
#	helper if all helpers are busy.  If this is 'off'
#	and the helper queue grows too large, Squid will exit
#	with a FATAL error and ask you to increase the number of
#	helpers.  You should only enable this if the helperss
#	are not critical to your caching system.  If you use
#	helpers for critical caching components, and you enable this 
#	option,	users may not get objects from cache.
#Default:
# store_id_bypass on
